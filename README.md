# Customer database

## Skills

This exercise should help you practice:

* accessing arrays
* accessing objects
* DOM manipulation
* using libraries
* using classes

## Directions

In this homework, you will build a customer database using DOM manipulation with JavaScript. You will get the customer data via a JavaScript file included with this project (`customers.js`) and format dates via a third-party library, [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/). You can also use other third-party libraries if you wish.

The customers were generated using [RandomUser.me](https://randomuser.me/), and so they contain a lot of data. For our purposes, you will need their name, address, phone numbers, thumbnail, birthdate, and the date they became a customer, which is stored as `registered` in the data.

### Using classes

Consider making a Customer class that takes one customer's data (one element of the `customers` array). Some methods you could implement:

  * `getName()` - returns the full name, capitalized correctly
  * `getAddress()` - returns the address, formatted correctly
  * `makeDOMNode()` - return the entire DOM node, probably a `div`, for displaying the customer


## Layout

Your site should look like the following screenshot:
